# HTTP Parser

Basic functionality of the HTTP parser: \
	- Convert the request from std::string to std::string_view \
	- Read the method and store it as an enum\
	- Read the URI and store it as a std::string_view\
	- Read the scheme and check that it is HTTP1.1\
	- Read the headers and store them as a std::map<std::string_view, std::string_view>\
